# First Assignment
Practicing using an md file type.

## Assignment
The assignment is to put the sizes.c project in gitHub using git

## Git Process
It's a few simple steps on the command line:

`$ git clone https://github.com/coecollege-cs/assignment-1-njpurcell`

`$ cd assignment-1-njpurcell`

`$ git add sizes.c`

`$ git commit -m "Your message here"`

`$ git push origin master`

And Voila I've committed my work to gitHub.
